# Changelog

All notable changes per release. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org)
pre-1.0 conventions: minor bumps may include breaking API changes (called out
explicitly), patch bumps are docs / build / fixes only.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-08-05

One way to launch a request, and streaming becomes a choice.

- **Breaking. `Request.Complete`, `Request.Stream` and `Request.CompleteInto`
  are gone. `Run(ctx)` and `RunInto(ctx, &dst)` are the whole launcher
  surface.**

  Migration is mechanical:

  | Before | After |
  |---|---|
  | `request.Run(ctx)` | unchanged |
  | `request.Complete(ctx)` | `request.Run(ctx)` |
  | `request.Stream(ctx, fn)` | `request.OnDelta(fn).Run(ctx)` |
  | `request.CompleteInto(ctx, &v)` | `request.RunInto(ctx, &v)` |

  The one behaviour change to check for: `Complete` did not send tools even
  when the request carried them, so `WithTool(...).Complete(ctx)` silently
  dropped them. `Run` sends whatever is configured. If a call site relied on
  that suppression, build the request without the tools instead.

  `Stream`'s callback was dispatched from the same line as `OnDelta`, with the
  same value, differing only by not taking a `ctx` — and it also disabled tools
  as a side effect of being a `Complete` variant. `OnDelta` chains, so a
  library and an application can both watch the same stream, which the single
  function pointer could not do.

- **New: `WithStreaming(bool)`, on both the client and the request.** elelem
  has always opened a streaming request; some OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible
  backends cannot serve one — an async job queue in front of the model has
  nowhere to put a token stream — and reject the call outright.

  ```go
  client := elelem.New(driver, elelem.WithStreaming(false)) // every request
  request.WithStreaming(false)                              // just this one
  ```

  The request-level setting wins over the client-level one in both directions.
  This changes the transport, not the API: `OnDelta` / `OnText` /
  `OnReasoning` still fire, tool calls still assemble, and the `Response` is
  identical — it just arrives in one piece.

- **`Driver` gains `Complete(ctx, DriverRequest, func(Delta) error)`** — the
  same call with streaming off, feeding the finished response through the same
  delta callback. A third-party driver must add it; see
  [docs/drivers.md](docs/drivers.md). `Capabilities.StreamingUnsupported`
  reports a provider that cannot stream at all, and then the non-streaming
  path is taken regardless of what was asked for. The field is phrased
  negatively on purpose: the zero value means streaming works, so a driver
  that never sets it keeps the existing behaviour.

- The Anthropic SDK refuses a non-streaming request whose `max_tokens` implies
  a run over ten minutes, locally, before sending anything. The Anthropic
  driver surfaces that as `ErrStreamingRequired` so it can be told apart from a
  transport failure.

- `RunInto` never sends tools, whatever the request carries — a typed object
  and a tool list are competing answers to the same turn. This used to fall out
  of `Complete`'s tool suppression; it is now stated where it happens.

- `elelemtest.ScriptedDriver` implements both paths and records which one each
  call took, via `Streamed()`. Both replay the same turn through the same
  callback, so a test asserting on the transport choice can keep every other
  assertion unchanged.

- The lint configuration now lists the `sdkprobe` build tag. Build-tagged files
  are skipped silently otherwise — the run stays green because it examined
  nothing.

## v0.3.1 — 2026-08-05

Test layout only. No API or behaviour change.

- The callback-chaining tests shipped in v0.3.0 as `callback_chain_test.go`,
  which names no source file. They cover `Request`'s `On*` setters and
  `ResetCallback`/`ResetCallbacks`, so they now live in `request_test.go`
  alongside the rest of that type's tests.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-05

Registering a callback twice adds a handler instead of discarding the first.

- **Breaking (behaviour, not signature): every `On*` method now APPENDS to a
  chain rather than replacing what was registered.** Both handlers run, in
  registration order, and the first to return an error stops the chain.

  The old behaviour failed by absence. A library that wired part of a request
  and a caller that added its own hook for the same event silently
  unregistered each other — no error, no log, just a handler that stopped
  running — and neither side could see the other to know it had happened.
  Found while composing an adapter with an application's own per-round hook.

  Code that registered exactly one handler per event is unaffected. Code that
  relied on the second registration winning must now clear the chain first.

- **New: `ResetCallback(kinds ...CallbackKind)` and `ResetCallbacks()`** are
  how a caller replaces rather than adds. `ResetCallbacks` clears every chain;
  `ResetCallback` clears only the kinds named, so a single handler can be
  swapped on a shared base request without disturbing the others:

  ```go
  base.
      ResetCallback(elelem.CallbackText).
      OnText(myOwnRenderer)
  ```

  `CallbackKind` is a typed string with one constant per `On*` method
  (`CallbackStart`, `CallbackText`, `CallbackRoundStart`, `CallbackToolResult`,
  ...). An unrecognized kind is ignored rather than clearing the wrong chain.

- `PreMaxTokensReached` and `PostMaxTokensReached` deliberately keep REPLACE
  semantics. `PreMaxTokensReached` exists to displace a built-in default, and
  both rewrite the transcript in place — chaining would run the second handler
  against the first one's output. Documented in `docs/callbacks.md`.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-05

Prompts are one immutable value, and messages carry multimodal content.

- **Breaking. `Message.Content` is now `Content` (an ordered `[]Part`), not
  `string`.** Text-only content is `elelem.Text("...")`; read it back with
  `Message.Text()`, which is what the engine, logging, and every provider field
  taking a bare string use. `ToolResult.Content` and `MessageInjection.Content`
  are unchanged — those are still plain strings.
- **Breaking. `WithSystemMessage`, `WithSystemMessagef`,
  `WithSystemMessageAppend`, `WithSystemMessageAppendf`,
  `WithSystemMessageAppendReset`, `WithHistory`, `WithHistoryFrom` and
  `WithMessages` are removed from `Request`.** They are now methods on a new
  `Prompt`, handed over in one call:

  ```go
  // before
  request.WithSystemMessage(rules).WithHistory(stored).WithPrompt(question)

  // after
  request.WithPrompt(elelem.NewPrompt().
      WithSystem(rules).WithHistory(stored).UserText(question))
  ```

  The old surface split one conversation across four builders and made the
  current turn a separate kind of thing from the messages before it, which it
  is not. `Prompt` is immutable — every method returns a new one — so a prompt
  can be built once and run repeatedly, against several models, from several
  goroutines.
- The system message is a field on `Prompt` rather than `messages[0]`. Two
  unrelated places used to depend on that position — the Anthropic driver
  hoisting it into that API's top-level `system` parameter, and history
  limiting pinning it against eviction — so "system is special" was a
  convention two files agreed on by hand. `Prompt.Messages()` is now the one
  place that decides where it goes.
- **Images, audio and documents.** `ImageURL`, `ImageBytes`, `AudioBytes`,
  `FileBytes` and `FileRef` build content parts for a user message. The
  providers disagree about how inline bytes travel — OpenAI packs them into the
  same `url` field as a `data:` URI, Anthropic uses a tagged source carrying
  `media_type` separately — and the drivers translate.
- **Content the model cannot read is refused locally**, with
  `ErrUnsupportedContent`, before the request is sent. `Capabilities` gained
  `SupportsImageInput`, `SupportsAudioInput` and `SupportsFileInput`. The flag
  is necessary but not sufficient: the driver still makes the final per-value
  call, so Anthropic's four-media-type image whitelist and its absent audio
  block still refuse. A structurally broken part is reported as invalid rather
  than unsupported, since switching models would not fix it.
- **`elelem.WithCapabilityOverride(fn)`** adjusts what a driver reports it can
  do, for a driver aimed at a compatible gateway whose model does not share the
  provider's abilities. It is a function of the model because capabilities are
  per-model, and it can only be trusted to restrict — widening a capability the
  driver cannot express moves the error later rather than removing it.
- Fixed: `cloneMessages` did not copy message content. With content as a string
  that was harmless; with byte payloads it left the engine's transcript
  aliasing the caller's image buffer, so a caller reusing that buffer would
  rewrite history already sent.
- New [docs/prompts.md](docs/prompts.md) covers the builder, the origin rules,
  the content parts, and what each provider accepts.

## v0.1.3 — 2026-08-05

**Relicensed from WTFPL to MIT.**

- MIT is the license every Go project here ships, and pkg.go.dev treats WTFPL
  poorly. The text is the canonical MIT wording verbatim so GitHub and
  pkg.go.dev both detect it.
- Nothing copyleft is linked in: the GPL and MPL modules under `vendor/`
  (`golangci-lint`, `grouper`, `sloglint`) are `tool` block dependencies used
  to build the linter, and `go list -deps ./...` confirms none of them appear
  in this module's import graph.

## v0.1.2 — 2026-08-05

README wording only. No code, no documentation-content change.

- Replaced the opening line and one section heading, which had been written by
  borrowing phrasing from a sibling project's README rather than saying what
  this one needed to say.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-08-04

Documentation accuracy pass. No API or behavior changes — every Go change in
this release is a comment.

- **Two exported doc comments were invisible on pkg.go.dev.** A stray `//` and
  a blank line detached the doc comments from `Client.Driver` and
  `DefaultTokenCounter`, so `go doc` returned bare signatures and the
  nil-receiver contract `Client.Driver` documents was not published anywhere.
- Corrected the tool-denial documentation in `docs/callbacks.md`. It described
  `OnToolCallStart` as a place a call can be denied. It is not: an error
  returned from that callback — or from any tool hook, including
  `Tool.PreRun` — aborts the whole run. Refusing one call while the run
  continues is `ToolCallDecision{CallID: ..., Deny: true}` passed to
  `ExecuteToolCalls`. The `CallID` is required; a decision that matches no
  pending call is discarded with a warning and the tool runs, so the previous
  example would have failed open.
- Corrected the context-budget rule in `docs/requests.md` and
  `docs/history.md`. Limiting is disabled in two cases, not one: when the model
  carries no `ContextSize`, **and** when the output reserve is greater than or
  equal to it — so a model at or under the default 4096-token reserve silently
  gets no limiting. The reserve itself defaults to `MaxOutputTokens` when set,
  otherwise 4096.
- Fixed the custom limiting-handler example in `docs/history.md`, which sliced
  the transcript at a raw index and could orphan a tool result — the exact
  failure the surrounding text warns against.
- Fixed `docs/drivers.md`, which showed `return elelem.ProviderError{...}`.
  That does not compile: `Error()` is declared on the pointer receiver.
- `docs/requests.md` now gives the full token-counter resolution order
  (request → client → driver → package default); the client tier was missing.
- `docs/structured-output.md`: response repair does not require strict
  validation, and is skipped for refusals as well as truncated responses.
- `README.md` reorganized — an example above the fold, a per-area table of what
  the module contains, a driver section covering both transports' shared
  options, and a logging section documenting the `LogReason*` constants.
- Corrected `README.md`'s trust-boundary section, which listed tool-result size
  among the engine's unconditional bounds. It is bounded only when
  `WithMaxToolResultTokens` is set, which is not the default.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-04

First standalone release. `elelem` previously lived inside another project as
an internal package; it is now its own module at
`github.com/psyb0t/elelem`, with no behavior changes in the extraction.

- Provider-neutral engine for streamed LLM requests: `Client`, `Request`,
  `Driver`, and the round/tool loop in `engine.go`.
- Drivers for OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`drivers/openai`) and Anthropic
  (`drivers/anthropic`), each translating portable requests and streams,
  validating provider transcript constraints, and normalizing finish reasons
  and usage.
- Tool loop with bounded concurrency, per-tool timeouts, panic recovery,
  result-size limits, hooks, denial decisions, and tool-driven message
  injection. Manual driving is the default — `Run` sends the tools and hands
  back `Response.ExecuteToolCalls`; `WithAutoToolCalls` opts into the engine
  running the loop itself.
- History limiting on whole transcript units, so an assistant tool call and
  its results are never split apart. Token budgeting via `WithMaxContextTokens`
  or `WithOutputReserveTokens`, with an embedded `o200k_base` estimator as the
  default counter.
- `WithRetry` driver decorator: retries transport failures, timeouts, rate
  limits and server errors, but only before the first streamed delta. Provider
  error codes are consulted ahead of HTTP status, since both providers report
  mid-stream failures in band inside an HTTP 200.
- Usage accounting that separates context from cost. `Usage.Total` counts only
  the attempt that succeeded; `Usage.BilledTotalTokens()` adds the tokens
  failed retries burned, and `Usage.Retry` itemizes every attempt. Both
  accumulate across the rounds of a tool loop.
- Structured output via `CompleteInto`, deriving a strict JSON Schema from the
  destination and assigning only after a successful decode.
- Test doubles in `elelemtest` (a scripted Driver that imports no test
  framework) and `elelemtest/mocks` (a generated `MockDriver`), plus the
  `elelemtest/conformance` contract suite that both shipped drivers run.
- Reference documentation under [`docs/`](docs/) covering requests, callbacks,
  tools, history and budgets, retries, structured output, driver authoring and
  testing. The README is the tour; `docs/` is where each surface is documented
  in full.
